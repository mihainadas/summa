# Project Summa

## Project Overview
Project Summa encompasses a variety of LLM-related research topics, beginning with _Glife_, a research initiative focused on diacritics restoration for Romanian texts using Large Language Models (LLMs). This initiative aims to improve the accuracy and integrity of text processing in Romanian, a language where diacritics play a crucial role.
